```
Extract the zip, drag the exe in the same directory as your simulation folder.
NOT INSIDE THE SIMULATION FOLDER, BUT INSTEAD WHERE THE SIMULATION FOLDER IS!
Then run the exe.
```

introducing split it!

an auto cache splitter for sheepit!

Download the exe and move it to in the same directory as your simulation cache is. run the exe. it's pretty straighforward.

enjoy!

This is actually my first actual program that does anything so it's not that good.

# How it works:
```
at first it goes to your cache folder. then it takes the first x files from the config file.
x is you, setting how much files it will take per folder. it could be 1/2/3 basically anything. only a number tho lol
it pastes those files in a different folder. it will first create a folder called 
Destination. it will store all the files and folders that are split. then it creates 
a folder called '1' then create another folder inside it that's the same name as
your simulation cache folder. and then create another folder called config inside it
and then paste those files in the config folder.

to show it visually it's doing this...

Destination
  ➡ 1
    ➡simulation folder name
      ➡config
        ➡the first x amount of files

the next step is doing the same thing for all those files. creates folders called 1, 2 , 3 etc basically an unique folder for each x amount of files

so now it looks like this:

Destination
  ➡ 1
    ➡simulation folder name
      ➡config
        ➡the first x amount of files
  ➡ 2
    ➡simulation folder name
      ➡config
        ➡the second x amount of files

then it does the same thing for the data and mesh folder in your simulation directory.

then it asks questions it would do with the guiding, noise, and particles folder. 
either split them too if they have files in them (which i personally didn't have on my projects) or just create those folders
that are named guiding, noise, and particles in the split cache directory so it works properly.

then it copy pastes your blend file in each sub folder in the destination folder.

that means....

Destination
  ➡ 1
    ➡your blend file
    ➡simulation folder name
      ➡config
        ➡the first x amount of files

  ➡ 2
    ➡your blend file
    ➡simulation folder name
      ➡config
        ➡the second x amount of files

etc etc

then it creates a zip for the 1 folder. then the 2 folder. so on and so on
the zip files are created in the Destination folder

Then it asks you if it shoudld delete the subfolders that were created while the spliiting happened.
You can choose to delete them. If you wish to do so, it will delete those 1, 2, 3 folders.
Deleting those folders won't matter because you'll still have the zips.
This functions was created so that you don't waste extra space. 

```
