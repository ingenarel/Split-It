```

Extract the zip, drag the exe in the same directory as your simulation folder. (NOT INSIDE THE SIMULATION FOLDER, BUT INSTEAD WHERE THE SIMULATION FOLDER IS!)
Then run the exe.
It will promt an installation folder.
Don't change it. install in the current directory. otherwise it won't work.
It's just a few bat files, a readme file and the license file. You can delete this later if you want to.
The password is split.
Why a password?
Because windows defender was flagging it as a virus. trojan to be exact.
However it's a false positive because I'm using a bat file to copy paste files.
So i password protected the exe and then put it in a zip and password protected it again.
PLEASE FOR GOD'S SAKE I DON'T RECCOMEND THIS IDEA FOR ANY OF YOUR PROJECTS AND IF SOMEONE USES THIS IDEA I CAN'T BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE! I'M JUST DESCRIBING WHAT I DID!
If somehow that's still gets flagged by defender, just go to defender, select the exe and allow threats.
If you don't trust the release tho, you can build it yourself. I showed that below.

introducing split it!

an auto cache splitter for sheepit!

Just download the release file. I created an sfx archive so you don't need to copy paste 17 bat files in your simulation cache directory for it to work lol.

Download the exe and move it to in the same directory as your simulation cache is. run the exe. it's pretty straighforward.

enjoy!

This is actually my first actual program that does anything so it's not that good.

# How to create the sfx file yourself:
## Step 1: Download the source code
### 1. Go to releases
![image](https://github.com/ingenarel/Split-It/assets/145784829/8eea42f5-b9be-4f7c-a729-702a66b111b0)
### 2. Go to downloads
![image](https://github.com/ingenarel/Split-It/assets/145784829/d1b468ad-db29-44d0-9553-53895566ad27)
### 3. Then either download the zip file or tar.gz file
![image](https://github.com/ingenarel/Split-It/assets/145784829/a4675ce7-1b11-443e-8e20-abfddb6cfe86)

### Step 2: Make the sfx file (self extracting exe file) with winrar:
I know that you can use 7-zip to do this. But I find it complex so i'm just gonna use winrar.
### 1. Extract the source code.
### 2. Select all the files, left click, and create an archive with winrar.
![image](https://github.com/ingenarel/Split-It/assets/145784829/04b90897-873c-44b6-9887-85cc86b7719a)
### 3. Choose any type of archive method and check the "Create sfx archive box"
![image](https://github.com/ingenarel/Split-It/assets/145784829/68b5bd26-1c33-4000-8da0-469995e175da)
### 4. Go to the advanced tab and click the sfx options
![image](https://github.com/ingenarel/Split-It/assets/145784829/259bc31b-f3bb-4c58-aaf0-b9b05d6878f0)
### 5. Go to the setup tab an in the run after extraction menu, copy and paste this: "Split_It.bat" (Don't use qoutation marks)
![image](https://github.com/ingenarel/Split-It/assets/145784829/fdf78ca3-ae61-4fe3-a619-593cf264b579)
### 5. Then click ok. and click ok again.

Now whenever you need to split your caches. drag and drop it where your simulation cache folder is, 
(NOT INSIDE THE SIMULATION FOLDER, BUT INSTEAD WHERE THE SIMULATION FOLDER IS!) and then run and install it in the current directory. 
It will promt an installation folder.
Don't change it. install in the current directory. otherwise it won't work.
It's just a few bat files, a readme file and the license file. You can delete this later if you want to.
It will autorun the files that are necessary...
And if windows defender still blocks it, select it and allow threats.


# How it works:
```
at first it goes to your cache folder. then it takes the first x files from the config file.
x is you, setting how much files it will take per folder. it could be 1/2/3 basically anything. only a number tho lol
it pastes those files in a different folder. it will first create a folder called 
Destination. it will store all the files and folders that are split. then it creates 
a folder called '1' then create another folder inside it that's the same name as
your simulation cache folder. and then create another folder called config inside it
and then paste those files in the config folder.

to show it visually it's doing this...

Destination
  ➡ 1
    ➡simulation folder name
      ➡config
        ➡the first x amount of files

the next step is doing the same thing for all those files. creates folders called 1, 2 , 3 etc basically an unique folder for each x amount of files

so now it looks like this:

Destination
  ➡ 1
    ➡simulation folder name
      ➡config
        ➡the first x amount of files
  ➡ 2
    ➡simulation folder name
      ➡config
        ➡the second x amount of files

then it does the same thing for the data and mesh folder in your simulation directory.

then it asks questions it would do with the guiding, noise, and particles folder. 
either split them too if they have files in them (which i personally didn't have on my projects) or just create those folders
that are named guiding, noise, and particles in the split cache directory so it works properly.

then it copy pastes your blend file in each sub folder in the destination folder.

that means....

Destination
  ➡ 1
    ➡your blend file
    ➡simulation folder name
      ➡config
        ➡the first x amount of files

  ➡ 2
    ➡your blend file
    ➡simulation folder name
      ➡config
        ➡the second x amount of files

etc etc

then it creates a zip for the 1 folder. then the 2 folder. so on and so on
the zip files are created in the Destination folder
```
