introducing split it!

an auto cache splitter for sheepit!

Just download the release file. I created an sfx archive so you don't need to copy paste 17 bat files in your simulation cache direcotry for it to work lol.

Download the exe and move it to in the same directory as your simulation cache is. run the exe. it's pretty straighforward.

enjoy!

This is actually my first actual program that does anything so it's not that good.
