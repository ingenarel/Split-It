BEFORE YOU START THIS MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE DOUBLE THE EMPTY SPACE IN YOUR DRIVE AS YOUR BLEND AND CACHE FILE COMBINED!
THAT MEANS IF YOUR BLEND FILE IS 100 mb AND YOUR SIMULATION CACHE FOLDER IS 900 mb, MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE ATLEAST 2 gb OF EMPTY SPACE IN YOUR DRIVE!

You can type 'Ver' to check if an update is there.
You can type 'cls' to clean the Terminal/Command Prompt.
Type 's' to use the splitter.
Type 'help' for an in depth guide about every command.
Type 'c' for credits.

    if someone edits this, be sure to remember to don't leave any trailing whitespaces.
